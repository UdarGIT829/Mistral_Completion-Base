[![CI](https://github.com/UdarGIT829/Mistral_Completion-Base/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/UdarGIT829/Mistral_Completion-Base/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
## Overview
This is a modular text-completion server based on https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src

By providing a barebones text-completion service via API, the systems for constructing prompts are free to control by a user. Currently available software for this purpose is geared towards being feature rich, and as a result becomes quite bloated. 

To adapt the outputs to your purposes, you can create/modify an existing instruct template or make your own.

## Installation
To install, run the following command:
```ps
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Starting the application server
```ps
>   python app.py 
```

For further usage, see `test.py` for specific examples.

## Modules
To extend functionality with your own module, you must make a `get_template()` function
See `.modules/instr_cls.py` for the class definition of the return type, or see `modules/template_module/generic_template.py` for a simplified example.
